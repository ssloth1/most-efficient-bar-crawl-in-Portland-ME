## Introduction
Our project originates from the desire to address a topic that is both relevant to our home campus at the Roux Institute and the wider context of Portland, Maine. The brewing industry in Portland, a key aspect of the city's tourism, stood out to us as an engaging subject for our Algorithms project.

## Project Question
The central question we aim to answer through our project is: "How do we optimize the route for a Portland, Maine brewery crawl starting at the Roux Institute by the shortest walking path in minutes?"

Our goal is to utilize Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm, to determine the most efficient path by walking time between various breweries in the city. The algorithm's application will involve calculating paths weighted in minutes that connect our brewery nodes.
